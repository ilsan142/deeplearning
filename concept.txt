Artificial Intelligence: A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including machine learning and deep learning.

Machine Learning: A set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a particular task rather than by explicitly programming them.

Neural Network: A construct in Machine Learning inspired by the network of neurons (nerve cells) in the biological brain. Neural networks are a fundamental part of deep learning, and will be covered in this course.

Deep Learning: A subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks. Often, “machine learning” and “deep learning” are used interchangeably.







Traditional Software Dev.
The input and the algorithm is known, and you write a function to produce an output

- Input data
- Apply logic to it
- Which produces a result

Machine Learning

You know the input and the output, but you don't know the algorithm that creates the output given the input

- Take pairs of input and output data
- Figure out the algorithm
